### Active Projects
[StreamControl](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.t4ils.obs_remote): Remote control app for OBS and Streamlabs OBS for Android using Flutter.<br>
[klonoa2-tools](https://github.com/entriphy/klonoa2-tools): Reverse engineering various things for the Playstation 2 game Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil.

### Previous Projects
[Spotify Playcount](https://github.com/entriphy/sp-playcount-librespot): Web API that returned information that could only be retrieved through Spotify's Hermes protocol in the desktop app. Spotify's HTTP API includes this info now, so this is not really needed anymore.<br>
[node-openrgb](https://github.com/entriphy/node-openrgb): Reverse engineering the protocol for the NZXT HUE+ and NZXT Smart Device. Not to be confused with [OpenRGB](https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB).<br>
[LineageOS Port for Galaxy S5 Sport](https://github.com/entriphy/android_device_samsung_kltesprsports): Since the device was very similar to the Galaxy S5 Sprint (`kltespr`), this was just basically renaming everything from the `kltespr` repository to make it compatible with `kltesprsports`. LineageOS started officially supporting the device a year or so later, but it is no longer maintained.<br>
[Destiny 2 Soundboard](https://github.com/entriphy/Destiny2-Soundboard): Soundboard of characters' voice lines from the game Destiny 2. Now maintained by [MadMikeyB](https://github.com/MadMikeyB/Destiny2-Soundboard).
